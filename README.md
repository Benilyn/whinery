#Whinery

##Synopsis

**_Whinery_** is an app that searches for 10 restaurants nearby their current location. It provides a map that will show the user their current location and the restaurants. This app also provides the user with the information about the restaurant and whines that other users have posted.

##Motivation

When I search for restaurants nearby my location, the reviews that I normally read are the bad reviews. I wanted to create an app that would allow users to whine about their latest dining experience.


##API Reference

**_Whinery_** uses [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial), which is an interactive map that is used to display on the web.


##Known Issue

There's a delay in displaying the Google map and list of nearby restaurants.
